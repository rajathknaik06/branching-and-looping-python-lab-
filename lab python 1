""" Janani is studying coordinate geometry, and she is curious about the quadrants in a coordinate plane. She wants to create a program that takes two integer inputs representing the coordinates of a point and determines in which quadrant the point lies.



Help her by writing a program to solve this problem.



Conditions

If both x and y are positive, the point lies in the first quadrant.
If x is negative and y is positive, the point lies in the second quadrant.
If both x and y are negative, the point lies in the third quadrant.
If x is positive and y is negative, the point lies in the fourth quadrant.
If both x and y are zero, the point is at the origin.
Input format :
The first line of input consists of an integer x, representing the point.

The second line of input consists of an integer y, representing the point.

Output format :
The output displays the quadrant in which the point lies or whether it lies at the origin. """

# You are using Python
x=int(input())
y=int(input())
 
if(x > 0 and  y > 0):
    print("The coordinate point lies in the first quadrant.")
elif(x < 0 and y > 0):
    print("The coordinate point lies in the second quadrant.")
elif(x < 0 and y < 0):
    print("The coordinate point lies in the third quadrant.")
elif(x > 0 and y < 0):
    print("The coordinate point lies in the fourth quadrant.")
elif(x == 0 and  y == 0):
    print("The coordinate point lies at the origin.")
